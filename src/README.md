This is a general overview over all typescript files.

## Main

main.ts only inlcudes the initialization of all files. This means adding event listeners and adding a default algorithm to the algorithm code.

## Algorithm Code

This folder includes the files which are responsible for displaying the algorithm code. This includes the drop down menu; which is responsible for running the *displayCodeAsString*-function. 

### Algorithms

These files includes functions of algorithm examples.
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- GCD
- Merge Sort

## Breakpoints

The functions of the files in the breakpoint folder takes care of the breakpoints. 
This includes adding and removing breakpoints from the algorithm code.
Additionally running and continuing the algorithm execution.
It also includes functions for highlighting and unhighlighting specific indices.

## Pseudocode

The purpose of these files is to add the spans within the pseudocode; 
creating a link between the algorithm code and the pseudocode.
